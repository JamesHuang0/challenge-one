# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Purpose

In this project I updated the HTML and CSS of the landing page of Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. to improve web accessibility and increase search engine optimization. In addition, errors in the HTML were fixed and some repetitive CSS was consolidated for long-term reliability. Comments were also added to CSS for better readability and comprehension of the code.    

## Changes Made to HTML

Changes to the header:

* <title> was made more precise in describing website. 

Changes to the body:

* Added an anchor to logo.
* Changed <div class="header"> to <header>.
* Added alt text to images.
* Added missing id to search-engine-optimization.
* Changed <div class="footer"> to <footer>.

## Changes Made to CSS

* Added comments.
* Changed appropriate header and footer element tags.
* Deleted repeated code and consolidated under parent HTML class.
