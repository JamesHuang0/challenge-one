# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Purpose

In this project I updated the HTML and CSS of the landing page of Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. to improve web accessibility and increase search engine optimization. In addition, errors in the HTML were fixed and some repetitive CSS was consolidated for long-term reliability. Comments were also added to CSS for better readability and comprehension of the code.
